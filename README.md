# aRPC - Antenna Remote Procedure Call
Antenna remote procedure call (aRPC) is an RPC protocol focused on distributed processing and HPC. aRPC is implemented over QUIC and inspired by gRPC's architecture.
One of the main focus of this project is being as ergonomic as possible for the developer while being fast, that's why we choose Colfer for our serialization tool and made some simplifications over gRPC architecture.  

### Architecture
If you want to check our architecture and design choices, check the project paper (link will be available soon).
### Usage
```go
```

### WIP
This project is currently a work in progress and should be not used in production environments.
